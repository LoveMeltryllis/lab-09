## assess myself 

I learned how to frame research questions to perform predictive analysis.

I found the autoplot() function very interesting and very helpful in future visualization. 

I consulted mainly on [here](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-9.html)

I would like to learn more about more models to interpret the features of data.
